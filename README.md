# file_sort
Inspiration from https://github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises (100 python exercises).<br /> <br />
I wanted to look at each exercise separate from solutions and hints, so I created this python script to do it for me.


## Use
1) Put input file in same folder as filesort.py
2) Run with python (python filesort.py)
3) Give inputs as required
